## TCP Chat Server

This program is a simple chat server built on top of TCP using NODE.js.

# Instructions

Start the server using `node index.js` from the `lab-nassir` directory. By default, it will use PORT 3000. Connect to the server from a different shell using `telnet localhost 3000`, or replace `localhost` with a server IP if connecting remotely.
